But first, Claudia Sheinbaum knows she has to fix Petroleos Mexicanos’ $106 billion debt problem. Most Read from Bloomberg Traders Are Cashing Out of Markets En Masse Magnificent Seven Earnings Arrive With Stocks at Critical Moment New York’s Rich Get Creative to Flee State Taxes. Auditors Are On to Them TikTok Divest-or-Ban Bill Expected to Become US Law in Days Elon Wants His Money Back “We have to work on two fronts: on the one hand, the refinancing of the debt,” the frontrunner said at Mexico’s annual banking convention in Acapulco Friday. “At the same time, the entry of Pemex into other energy sources or other types of electricity generation.” Pushing Pemex to embrace new and cleaner technologies would be a substantial shift from its traditional oil-and-gas focus under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. Bondholders warn it’s unlikely to succeed unless the company and government address Pemex’s financial woes, slash its debt and boost flagging production. “Pemex doesn’t have the cash for green energy projects,” said Adriana Eraso, a corporate analyst at Fitch Ratings in New York. “Only in very rare cases are renewables profitable enough to make up for revenues generated from fossil fuels.” Sheinbaum said Friday she expected Pemex to refinance its bonds ahead of upcoming maturities in 2025, a plan that may free up cash for the company to play a role in Mexico’s energy transition. Read More: Mexico Presidential Frontrunner Sees Pemex Refinancing Debt “Most likely the current Pemex CEO and the president are going to leave us with a long-term plan,” Sheinbaum said. Cleaning up the image of Pemex — the most indebted company in emerging markets and the world’s most indebted oil producer — has potential global resonance as banks and investors increasingly eye companies committed to environmental, social and governance metrics. A new direction for the beleaguered driller could also transform Mexico, which recently surpassed China as the largest US trading partner amid a potential nearshoring boom. One of the realities Sheinbaum faces is that global oil majors are dialing back their green ambitions as returns on renewable investments sag. Companies including Shell Plc and BP Plc have cut their emissions reduction targets, citing “uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition.” Unlike other oil majors, however, Pemex doesn’t have much financial breathing room to undertake a green shift. It’s facing billions in late payments to service providers and its infrastructure is crumbling after years of underinvestment, causing a slew of accidents, oil spills and methane leaks in recent years. Sheinbaum, an environmental engineer and former Mexico City mayor who looks poised to replace Lopez Obrador, first outlined her energy strategy last month, on a national holiday commemorating the expropriation of foreign oil assets in 1938. Her plan would cap Pemex’s oil production in coming years at around 1.8 million barrels a day — an increase from about 1.5 million barrels now — while the government focuses on sparking growth in green energy. She’d do that by broadening Pemex’s scope to include technologies such as lithium extraction and electric-vehicle infrastructure, and by empowering state power company Comision Federal de Electricidad to invest in renewable resources and bolster electricity transmission networks. Sheinbaum would spend about $13.6 billion on new projects to boost Mexico’s use of renewable energy while still adding gas-burning power plants. She’d also increase wind and solar power generation, modernize hydroelectric stations and add about 3,850 kilometers (2,390 miles) of transmission lines. Her blueprint also reflects a sustainability plan recently released by Pemex to attract ESG investors by slashing its greenhouse-gas emissions. Critics fault Sheinbaum’s aim to keep financially distressed state entities at the center of Mexico’s energy sector, leaving private companies by the wayside. It’s a strategy that AMLO, as the current president is known, relied on to promote “energy sovereignty.” Since 2018, he’s rolled back the pro-market reforms of his predecessor and invested billions in growing Mexico’s domestic fuel-refining capacity. “Sheinbaum’s recent statements have deviated from promises she made regarding a more private sector-friendly approach in the pre-campaign period,” said Alejandro Schtulmann, research director at Mexico City-based political consultancy EMPRA. Sheinbaum said Friday that there must be clear rules for private sector investment in Mexico’s energy sector, and that public sector investments in Pemex would take time to “bear fruit.” A Pemex spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment. Pemex’s oil and gas output has also withered to less than half of what it was two decades ago. Slashing debt is key to turning around the company’s finances, since money that could be spent fixing aging equipment is instead being used to cover unpaid bills and interest payments. The company has lately relied on tax breaks and cash injections from the government to stanch the financial bleeding. AMLO has lavished support on Pemex, granting it as much as 1.37 trillion pesos (around $80 billion) over the course of his administration, which hasn’t reversed the company’s decline. While investors expect government support to continue under Sheinbaum, she has said little about what she would do to address Pemex’s financial problems over the long term. She’ll also be up against strained public finances. Mexico is facing its largest budget deficit since the 1980s as AMLO spends big at the end of his presidential term, according to Oscar Ocampo, an energy analyst at IMCO, a nonprofit that focuses on competitiveness. “AMLO entered office with a much easier financial situation than Sheinbaum will inherit,” Ocampo said. To be sure, Sheinbaum is still in campaign mode. Polls show her more than 20 percentage points up on opposition rival Xochitl Galvez, who is proposing a corporate restructuring for Pemex that would include selling assets and closing refineries, as well as opening the energy sector to private investment. The frontrunner hasn’t strayed from AMLO’s stance of keeping state-owned companies at the forefront of Mexico’s energy sector, but that strategy may change if she wins on June 2, said Luis Maizel, a senior managing director at LM Capital Group in San Diego, which holds about $18.5 million in Pemex bonds. “We’ll see Sheinbaum grow eight feet taller when she takes over,” Maizel said. “Mexico needs more energy and doesn’t have enough money. She’ll have to lean on the private sector.” (Updates with additional comment from Sheinbaum in the sixth paragraph. An earlier version corrected the year in the 15th paragraph.)

The effort comes amid growing calls for these institutions to boost financing under favorable conditions to developing countries, which face greater challenges in climate transition and are more affected by the environment of higher global interest rates. \"Together, we will be able to achieve more, with greater impact and on a larger scale,\" said IDB President, Ilan Goldfajn. Following a retreat held in Washington at the IDB headquarters, on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings, the MDBs said the agreed plan involves \"joint steps to work more effectively as a system,\" as reported by Reuters on Wednesday. The group includes institutions such as the World Bank Group, the New Development Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European Investment Bank, and the African Development Bank. The IDB said in a statement that the increased financing capacity will be supported by the offer of innovative financial instruments and by promoting the channeling of the IMF\\'s Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) through MDBs. The IDB also foresaw actions \"providing more clarity on callable capital, which would help rating agencies better assess the value of callable capital.\" The MDBs also committed to boosting action on climate change, envisioning the delivery of a common approach to measuring climate results on adaptation and mitigation, and reporting climate financing jointly. The other pillars of work agreed upon on Saturday include strengthening country-level collaboration and co-financing, catalyzing private-sector mobilization, and enhancing development effectiveness and impact.

Most Read from Bloomberg Traders Are Cashing Out of Markets En Masse Magnificent Seven Earnings Arrive With Stocks at Critical Moment New York’s Rich Get Creative to Flee State Taxes. Auditors Are On to Them TikTok Divest-or-Ban Bill Expected to Become US Law in Days Elon Wants His Money Back The pullback was triggered in part by comments from Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams, who said there’s no rush to cut interest rates and it’s possible that economic data could even warrant an increase if inflation persists. The realization that the interest rate pivot had yet to arrive comes as the US economy continues its strong performance, causing financial conditions to loosen in recent months. As a result, the market isn’t yet showing signals that the central bank has restricted policy enough to begin easing, said Bill Zox, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. The return of the higher-for-longer mantra is a headache for insurance companies and pension plans which, flush with cash, sent demand for bonds soaring this year as they tried to lock in yields ahead of the anticipated cuts. Corporates responded by issuing more than $1 trillion of notes globally so far this year, the second-highest level since at least 2013. Now, however, investors are yanking money from high-yield funds and flows into shorter duration high-grade products have slowed dramatically. Click here to listen to a podcast about how Morgan Stanley thinks credit could be in trouble if the Fed hikes. For US investment-grade debt, spreads are only edging wider, and demand for many new issues is still strong. But signs of growing caution are clear in credit markets: Spreads on US junk debt have pushed wider after the rise in negative sentiment, and high-yield is poised for the biggest monthly loss on a total return basis since September 2022. It’s a marked reversal of the sense of complacency that earlier this month saw the global perception of risks from credit reach the lowest levels since February of last year, according to a Bank of America Corp. survey of fund managers. Adding to the problems for policymakers, retaliatory strikes between Israel and Iran have sent oil prices higher, which could fuel inflation. The tensions in the Middle East also risk dampening demand for credit as investors seek havens like Treasuries instead. Investor Pushback One area where investors are pushing back is the leveraged loan market. While it continues to see demand, money managers have successfully pushed back on terms sought by issuers in recent days. Rocket Software Inc. was forced to drop plans for a portable debt structure in recent days after feedback from money managers, according to people with knowledge of the matter. If the trend continues, it’s a potential positive for private credit providers, who have faced renewed competition in recent months from banks. In Europe, it’s a different story. Traders are pricing around 80 basis points of cuts from the European Central Bank this year and officials have stressed they still plan to cut first in June and don’t need to wait for the Fed. Still, the volatility this week means more than 70% of bond deals issued in Europe were in the red as of Friday morning in London, hurting retail investors, data compiled by Bloomberg News show. Back in the US, some junk firms risk being hurt by the tightening in monetary policy. “If those cuts get pushed out after the election, it could be a challenge for some of the lower-quality floating-rate issuers” who need to refinance, Meghan Robson, head of US credit strategy at BNP Paribas, said in an April 10 interview with the Credit Edge podcast. “That risk is not priced in yet but is something that could come into the debate as we get closer to the June and July timeline.” Week in Review Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co. and Goldman Sachs sold bonds this week in the US high-grade bond market, following their release of first-quarter results. Wells Fargo & Co. sold $4.25 billion on Monday, and C$1.25 billion ($900 million) of debt in the Canadian bond market on Tuesday, while Morgan Stanley sold $8 billion of bonds Wednesday, after it posted higher-than-expected quarterly revenue. Banks are fighting back after private lenders have grabbed ever larger pieces of the lucrative business of financing leveraged buyouts: They’re serving as matchmakers on transactions between smaller companies looking for loans and private lenders eager to provide financing. Wall Street’s securitization engine is revving up with issuance touching record levels as borrowers rush to secure funding before any credit market disruptions caused by the US general election. The US leveraged loan market, as yet unruffled by the shift to a higher-for-longer view on interest rates, may soon join in the pain being felt in other asset classes. Fading hopes that the Federal Reserve will soon cut rates are prompting US banks to re-evaluate the cost of their preferred stocks, potentially sparking a rush of deals for the crucial source of capital. Banks are increasingly gathering orders for riskier high-yield bond and leveraged loan sales in private before formally announcing them to the broader market, in an effort to ensure deals find enough demand in difficult markets. Blackstone Inc. led a roughly $2 billion financing package to Park Place Technologies to refinance the company’s debt and fund a payout to its private equity owners. As climate change exacerbates droughts and wildfires, and utilities often take the blame for starting them, their assets are increasingly at risk. Riverside Co. is exploring strategic options including a sale of its direct lending arm, Riverside Credit Solutions. Asset manager Columbia Threadneedle Investments thinks that now is a good time to grab a bigger piece of the collateralized loan obligation market, recently saying it plans to expand its CLO business and become a regular issuer. Alternative asset manager Sculptor Capital Management has launched a platform to invest in the riskiest tranches of CLOs, which will count its new owner Rithm Capital Corp. as a key investor. Library services companies Baker & Taylor and Media Source Inc. have held talks to combine and have approached direct lenders about financing for the potential deal. Bayview Asset Management, a money manager, is in the process of marketing a complex bond that was created to help SoFi Technologies Inc., an online bank and lender, hedge part of its student loan book. Vietnamese companies are cutting back on issuing new bonds as yields rise and the government heightens scrutiny on capital markets, a development that’s stirring refinancing risk concerns. On the Move Toronto-Dominion Bank’s head of private debt has left the firm amid a restructuring at the Canadian lender that includes cutting 3% of jobs globally.

Speaking to national broadcaster SRF, he said economic growth and productivity are too low and many countries are running too much debt and excessive deficits. One of the most pressing challenges is insufficient growth, Jordan told SRF. Another is the need for structural reforms to increase countries\\' productivity and boost growth, he added. \"In many countries the debt level is too high, deficits are too big,\" Jordan said on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. \"That cannot be sustainable and will have to be corrected in the future. \"It is very important that at the same time monetary policy remains geared towards price stability, rather than monetary policy being needed to finance debt, otherwise it will not end well.\" (Reporting by Noele Illien; Writing by Francois Murphy)'}, {'title': '', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chile-central-bank-president-sees-165507342.html', 'datetime': '2024-04-20T18:50:10.000Z', 'content': 'Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results News •6 minutes ago News •2 hours ago News •4 hours ago News •7 hours ago News •9 hours ago News •22 hours ago News •23 hours ago News •24 hours ago Breaking News •yesterday News •yesterday News •yesterday Breaking News •yesterday News •yesterday Morning Brief •yesterday News •2 days ago News •2 days ago News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Morning Brief • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 (Bloomberg) -- Chile’s central bank President Rosanna Costa said plans to extend one of the world’s biggest rate-cutting cycles remain intact as policymakers have already incorporated new global risks into their outlook. Most Read from Bloomberg Traders Are Cashing Out of Markets En Masse Magnificent Seven Earnings Arrive With Stocks at Critical Moment New York’s Rich Get Creative to Flee State Taxes. Auditors Are On to Them TikTok Divest-or-Ban Bill Expected to Become US Law in Days Elon Wants His Money Back The bank’s message is that borrowing costs will fall further and the size of cuts will be decided each meeting, Rosanna Costa said in an interview on Saturday during the International Monetary Fund’s Spring meetings in Washington. The institution’s projections are cautious and already consider threats including higher transportation costs and US rate cuts beginning only toward end-2024. “Consequently, we are within our range,” Costa said. “When we deliver our message, we indicate a range of movements that we can use to determine if the base outlook hasn’t changed. If there are relatively small changes, then you can think that you’re still in range.” Policymakers led by Costa — the first female central bank chief in Chile’s history — are extending their easing cycle though at a more gradual pace after upside inflation and activity surprises this year. The monetary authority has lowered borrowing costs 475 basis points in total since July, to 6.5%. Still, they recently signaled that it will take longer for inflation to hit the 3% target. Chile-watchers are paying close attention to price pressures from a weaker peso, which has declined 8% against the dollar this year. A depreciated currency raises the cost of imports, and Chile is especially vulnerable given it’s a relatively small and open economy that imports the majority of its fuels. While a further rise in transportation costs stemming from Middle East tensions is a possibility, it is not a “central element,” Costa said. Furthermore, the current situation fails to put an upward bias on the bank’s inflation forecasts. “The right thing to do is to be alert,” Costa said. “Until now, there hasn’t been an escalation. We are still within the outlook for our projections.” Costa reiterated that Chile is better-positioned to confront external shocks now than in the past and that decisions on future rate cuts will be cautious, taking into account macroeconomic developments. “Our economy requires that interest rates continue to fall,” she said. “That will happen at a speed that we decide meeting-by-meeting.” Chile’s consumer prices have surprised markets since the start of the year. After blowing past analyst expectations in both January and February, monthly inflation came in less than all forecasts in March. Meanwhile, economic activity has posted broad-based gains since the start of the year, according to the central bank’s proxy for gross domestic product. Put together, this month central bankers raised their 2024 year-end inflation forecast to 3.8% from 2.9%. Both economists and traders surveyed by the monetary authority now expect policymakers to slow the pace of easing at the second straight meeting in May, delivering a half-point cut. That decline would follow April’s reduction of 75 basis points and January’s drop of 100 basis points.

Its launch has been nothing short of a home run, helping the company quickly expand beyond its previous focus on government contracts. This newfound growth, coupled with euphoria surrounding AI, caused shares to rise 167% last year.

This past week, those assurances disappeared. \"The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that it\\'s likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence,\"he said Tuesday while speaking at an event in Washington, D.C. The message from Powell was clear: Rates are going to stay higher longer than expected. He wasn’t the only important voice at the Fed who made such a pivot in the last week. Three other Fed officials also struck a more hawkish stance due to hotter-than-anticipated inflation data in the first quarter. They included Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee, one of the more dovish members of the Fed. Known for his earlier view that the Fed was on a \"golden path\" to getting inflation down without high unemployment, Goolsbee acknowledged Fridaythat \"progress on inflation has stalled\" and that it now \"makes sense to wait\" before cutting rates. Another about-face came from New York Fed president John Williams,who said Thursday he doesn’t see any \"urgency\" to cut rates and didn\\'t rule out raising them if inflation were to heat up further. That caution came just four days after Williams said in a TV interview that rate cuts would \"likely\" start this year.'}, {'title': '', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-what-1-million-buys-in-todays-housing-market-133518373.html', 'datetime': '', 'content': ''}, {'title': '', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-2-micro-companies-powering-the-small-cap-russell-2000-this-year-chart-of-the-week-120029786.html', 'datetime': '2024-04-20T12:00:29.000Z', 'content': 'Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results News •7 minutes ago News •2 hours ago News •4 hours ago News •7 hours ago News •9 hours ago News •22 hours ago News •23 hours ago News •24 hours ago Breaking News •yesterday News •yesterday News •yesterday Breaking News •yesterday News •yesterday Morning Brief •yesterday News •2 days ago News •2 days ago News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Morning Brief • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 This is The Takeaway from today\\'s Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we\\'re watching What we\\'re reading Economic data releases and earnings We all know the“Magnificent Seven,”the current crop of megacaps that broke away from the S&P 500’s peloton of stocks. A group that hassince dwindled to just four. But the small-cap Russell 2000 index has its own pair of Magnificent members: “The Micros.” Together, MicroStrategy (MSTR), the bitcoin proxy play led by theendlessly quotable Michael Saylor, and Super Micro Computer (SMCI), a cloud storage company riding the AI demand for more computing power, are responsible for single-handedly keeping theindex’s year from going from bad to worse. The Russell is down well over 3% this year, and without these two stocks’ performance, it would be down around 7% as of Thursday, according to DataTrek. As DataTrek’s co-founder Nicholas Colas put it this week, “The Russell needs a few more meme-ish stocks, not fewer, if it is to start generating better returns.” These numbers were even worse on Friday, as Super Micro fell as much as 19% after the company announced its earnings date but didn’tpre-announceearnings. A bit like being punished for showing up to a party on time but not sufficiently greeting and thanking the hosts. Index concentration has been a running theme of market commentary since the Magnificent Seven emerged last year. The influence of the S&P 500’s top 10 stockshas now reached new highson the index and has been surgingabove historical normssince 2019. For the Russell, this concentration appears even more fragile when you consider the business behind the two ‘micro’ stars. MicroStrategy has chained itself to the bow of the SS Bitcoin, with its CEOcalling the world’s largest cryptocurrencythe investment world’s \"apex property\" and maintaining that the company\\'s \"endgame is to acquire more bitcoin.\" The scandal-prone Super Micro,which I wrote about two months ago, is essentially an offshoot of the Magnificent Seven’s AI focus, building customizable servers for the nascent technology. As Colas rightly said, there is some meme stock energy at work here with off-brand AI and crypto. But there’s another key reminder here for investors, which is that this is actually how indexes are supposed to work. A top-heavy index, the idea goes, is a tower built on sand, and investors should be waiting for the other shoe to drop. After all, how healthy can a stock market and economy be if the vast majority of companies are lagging the index? Coming into the year, one of Wall Street’s favorite calls was a view that gains would broaden. As Josh Schafer wrote Friday,this call has been a bust so far. But as we have coveredfor years, the point of an index is that sometimes one sector — or company, even — outperforms, and investors who buy the whole basket benefit just the same. Moreover, in the S&P 500’s history, just ahandful of stocks have frequently been responsible for the bulk of gains. As Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snidertold us in February, “New companies grow, and they become larger weights in the index, and they drag the market higher with them.” Or, in the case of the Russell 2000, theygraduate to the big leagues.

The IPO priced at $120 per share, but the stock finished its first day of trading above $250 per share. Now, approaching four years later, Snowflake stock is down about 40% from where it closed on day one. In short, it's been a complete dud for early investors. I wouldn't blame Snowflake entirely for the poor performance of its stock because the business has excelled. Here's how its financials have looked in each of its four complete fiscal years since its IPO. Metric Fiscal 2021 Fiscal 2022 Fiscal 2023 Fiscal 2024 Product revenue growth 120% 106% 70% 38% Free cash flow margin (14%) 7% 24% 28% Source: Snowflake's press releases. Table by author. Snowflake's revenue is nearly five times higher now than when it went public, and it generates strongfree cash flow. The stock fell during this time, nonetheless, because it was priced irrationally high at its peak. Indeed, at one point, Snowflake stock traded at over 100 times trailing sales. That sometimes happens with small companies, but Snowflake was already a large business at the time. In short, it's hard to find upside when shares are that expensive. That said, the chart below shows it's fallen to an all-time low valuation. With the stock still underperforming and valuation at a new low, it's time to consider whether Snowflake stock is finally a buy.\"}, {'title': '', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-is-anxious-over-netflixs-decision-to-stop-sharing-subscriber-numbers-113308943.html', 'datetime': '2024-04-20T11:33:08.000Z', 'content': 'Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results News •7 minutes ago News •2 hours ago News •4 hours ago News •7 hours ago News •9 hours ago News •22 hours ago News •23 hours ago News •24 hours ago Breaking News •yesterday News •yesterday News •yesterday Breaking News •yesterday News •yesterday Morning Brief •yesterday News •2 days ago News •2 days ago News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Morning Brief • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 Netflix (NFLX) will stop reporting subscriber figures at the start of next year. That doesn\\'t sit well with Wall Street. The stock fell as much as 9% on Friday following the news, which was revealed as part of the company\\'s first quarter earnings reportthe day prior. It\\'s a surprising announcement, especially for an industry that\\'s historically tied company performance to subscriber gains or losses. Along with subscribers, the company will also stop reporting a key profitability metric — average revenue per member, or ARM. Netflix\\'s first quarter earnings beat across the board, but disappointing Q2 and full-year revenue forecasts overshadowed the results. That, coupled with the streamer\\'s plans to scrap membership metrics, added to investor anxiety about whether or notrecent growth momentumcan be sustained over the long term. \"While still early, the potential concern is subscriber growth had significantly decelerated in 2022 (prior to the implementation of [Netflix\\'s password sharing crackdown]),\" Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich wrote in a note to clients on Friday. \"This could be a harbinger of decelerating subscriber growth in the future.\" It\\'s been about a year sinceNetflix first implemented its password crackdown, which targeted 100 million global users sharing accounts. Analysts say the move contributed to the bulk of the streamer\\'s new subscriber additions in recent quarters as viewers who were using the accounts of friends or family members suddenly had to get their own. So far, the initiative has paid off, with the company adding 9.3 million subscribers in Q1 after 13 million subscribers were added in the fourth quarter. But Wall Street seems convinced the benefits of the crackdown are beginning to dwindle. \"We do believe the lowest hanging fruit has already been captured,\" MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson wrote on Friday. \"Netflix has talked about expanding its crackdown into previously untouched mobile users, though it is unclear how large this opportunity is and remains to be seen whether this effort can deliver similar results.\" In other words, the move to no longer report subscribers \"can be read more cautiously that subscriber growth has indeed peaked — particularly in higher ARM markets — and a deceleration may lie ahead,\" he warned. Nathanson maintained his Neutral rating on shares but raised his price target by $5 to $505 a share. Citi analyst Jason Bazinet agreed, telling Yahoo Finance, \"The stock really worked because the company has been beating net adds. The Street knows it\\'s on password sharing. What they want to see is, when we begin to lap some of these password-sharing benefits, what\\'s going to carry the water? How are they going to get these net adds?\" \"That\\'s why there\\'s so much anxiety,\" he continued. \"It implies to someone that there isn\\'t really a natural transition to continue sub growth [post-password sharing.]\"'}, {'title': '', 'link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-tech-stocks-smoked-nvidia-tumbles-10-to-cap-worst-week-of-the-year-200313365.html', 'datetime': '2024-04-19T20:12:29.000Z', 'content': \"Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant results News •8 minutes ago News •2 hours ago News •4 hours ago News •7 hours ago News •9 hours ago News •22 hours ago News •23 hours ago News •24 hours ago Breaking News •yesterday News •yesterday News •yesterday Breaking News •yesterday News •yesterday Morning Brief •yesterday News •2 days ago News •2 days ago News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 18, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 17, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 16, 2024 Morning Brief • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 16, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 Breaking News • Apr 15, 2024 Wall Street retreated on Friday as dimming hopes for a coming interest rate cut and geopolitical uncertainty intensified a sell off in Big Tech. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.9%,notching its sixth consecutive losing day, and suffering its worst losing streak since October 2022. The benchmark index lost more than 3% for the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slid 2.1%, falling more than 5% for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) managed to rise about 0.6%. Disappointing earningsfrom Netflix (NFLX) weighed on hopes that quarterly reports would help revive the equity rally. Shares of the streaming giant, the first of the megacap techs to update, slid 9%. Technology stocks as a whole flashed red with all of the biggest names shedding value. Market darling Nvidia (NVDA) lost 10%, while Amazon (AMZN) saw a drop of more than 2%. Apple (AAPL) decreased 1%. The market had come back from a deeper sell-off afterIsrael's retaliatory strike on Iranspooked traders overnight and spurred a rush to safe havens such as gold. But investors are still on high alert, thoughIran has confirmed the drone attackand said it failed. Stocks were already under pressure before the shock amid persistent uncertainty about Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. A growing number of Fed officials this weekexpressed a more hawkish stancebecause of hotter-than-anticipated inflation data in the first quarter. Meanwhile, US government bondspulled back almost fullyfrom their biggest rally of the year. The yield on the safe-haven 10-year Treasury (^TNX) fell to trade around 4.6%. In commodities, Brent crude futures (BZ=F) — the global oil benchmark — traded around 0.2% higher to around $87 a barrel.

After years of booming growth, the AI industry is now experiencing a significant slowdown in investment, as detailed in a recent report from Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). The report highlights a notabledecrease in both private and corporate investments in the AI sectorfor the second consecutive year, with overall investments dropping by 20% in 2023 compared to the previous year, Kyle reports. Despite this general downturn, certain segments like generative AI continue to attract significant funding, indicating a selective yet substantial interest in specific AI applications. AI investment is slowing down for a few reasons, like the crowded market andthe steep costs of building big AI models. According to Gartner analyst John-David Lovelock, the money is now flowing more toward big, established companies that are strengthening their positions, while it's getting tougher for new players to get a piece of the pie. Investors are getting pickier and want to see real, solid returns instead of just throwing money at hopeful growth. (That isn't stopping them fromraising billion-dollar funds focusing on AI, of course.) Despite these hurdles, there's still a strong belief inthe future of AI, especially in ways it can boost efficiency and spark innovation across different sectors. Right now, the market is just going through a bit of a cleanup, shifting from the wild spending of the past to a more thoughtful and sustainable way of funding. This change is key to creating AI solutions that actually work in the real world and can truly change industries, and worm its way into our battle-weary hearts.

Most Read from Bloomberg Traders Are Cashing Out of Markets En Masse Magnificent Seven Earnings Arrive With Stocks at Critical Moment New York’s Rich Get Creative to Flee State Taxes. Auditors Are On to Them TikTok Divest-or-Ban Bill Expected to Become US Law in Days Elon Wants His Money Back This metric has long been the primary way Wall Street evaluated the company’s performance, but executives at Netflix, which now has almost 270 million subscribers, have tried to shift the focus to measures like sales and profit. Other tech giants like Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have taken similar steps in recent years. In the past, subscriber numbers have been wildly unpredictable, and the company has struggled to forecast them accurately. In 2022, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said it would stop projecting quarterly customer data. The stock typically sees big swings the day after earnings reports. On Thursday, Netflix reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, including 9.33 million new subscribers. But the shares slumped after the company said user growth this quarter would slow and that it will stop reporting customer numbers. “Eliminating regular reporting of membership data raises questions around management’s confidence to further grow the base, though it is not implausible that the change is intended to reduce quarterly sentiment volatility around relatively small changes in true economic drivers,” Michael Morris, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Netflix isn’t the only big tech company to pull back on disclosing some metrics in order to steer investors’ focus elsewhere. In 2018, Apple said it would no longer report the number of iPhones, Macs and iPads sold each quarter, as it attempted to focus on its growing services unit. While some pundits praised the move as a way to highlight a potent new business model, others complained it was an attempt to hide the pain of a stagnant smartphone market. The shares had their worst day in four years. Last quarter, Meta said it will no longer report the number of subscribers to its family of apps, which now total almost 4 billion people who use Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp each month. The San Francisco-based company said it also won’t provide daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app. Beginning this quarter, Meta will report year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps. “Fewer disclosures is a rite of passage for large tech companies namely Apple, Google, and Meta,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. “On the other hand, removing growth disclosures signals a maturing business, and gives shareholders even fewer data points to underwrite forecasts. Time will tell how investors digest the change.” The good news for Netflix is that its decision, while angering some investors, is unlikely to have any impact on customers — its primary focus. In 2011, the company was forced to backtrack on plans to split its mail-order DVD and internet streaming services. Customers were outraged over plans to create a separate DVD offering called Qwikster, and to pay for each service separately. The company reversed the decision three weeks later. Netflix’s growth in the latest quarter was aided by a crackdown on account sharing, which pushes viewers using someone else’s password to sign up on their own at a discounted rate. The company attracted new customers from all over the world, thanks to a strong slate of original programs, showing particular strength in the US and Canada. Those new subscribers helped the company beat forecasts for sales and earnings as well. In explaining the decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers and average revenue per user, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said initiatives like the crackdown and a new ad-supported tier make those metrics less relevant. “All of that means that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,” he said in a video interview Thursday.

Grayscale said it will contribute 10% of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) assets to the Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC). Grayscale, which currently offers the highest-cost spot bitcoin ETF, revealed that a planned spinoff version of the fund will have a 0.15% fee, which would be the lowest of them all, according to pro forma financials in itslatest filing. The existing Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) has a 1.5% fee. When Grayscale'sBitcoin Mini Trust(BTC) is introduced, the filing says the company will contribute 10% of the assets in GBTC to the BTC Trust. Shares of the BTC trust are to be issued and distributed automatically to holders of GBTC shares. (The pro forma financial statements are projections of future expenses and revenues, based on a company's past experience and future plans.) Grayscale’s Bitcoin Mini Trust was conceived to offer GBTC investors a lower fee option that’s more competitively in line with other bitcoin ETFs approved back in January. Currently, the Franklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC) at 0.19% is the lowest-cost spot bitcoin ETF. The Grayscale spinoff is also considered a non-taxable event for GBTC’s existing shareholders, so those investors will not be expected to pay capital-gains tax to automatically transfer into the new fund. Some early stage GBTC investors with gains in the thousands of percentages would face a significant taxable event to switch to a competitor product with a lower fee. Grayscale’s GBTC appeared over a decade ago, originally offered through a private placement. In mid-2015, the shares began trading publicly on an over-the-counter basis. This continued until January 2024 when GBTC uplisted to NYSE Arca as a spot bitcoin ETF, along with competition products from other companies including BlackRock and Fidelity. Grayscale’s current assets under management stands at around $19.6 billion; its nearest rival, which is BlackRock’s IBIT fund, has grown to just over $17.5 billion.
